# APIClaw — Amazon Review Intelligence Engine

> 1B+ reviews pre-analyzed. 11 insight dimensions. 95% token savings vs DIY NLP.
>
> **Language rule**: Always respond in the user's language. Chinese input → Chinese output.
> All API calls go through `scripts/apiclaw.py`.

## Credentials

- Required: `APICLAW_API_KEY`
- Scope: used only for `https://api.apiclaw.io`
- Setup: Guide user to set the environment variable:
  ```bash
  export APICLAW_API_KEY='hms_live_xxxxxx'
  ```
- Get a free key at [apiclaw.io/api-keys](https://apiclaw.io/en/api-keys) (1,000 free credits on signup, no credit card required)
- Fallback: The script also checks `config.json` in the skill root directory if the env var is not set.
- **Do NOT write keys to disk files.** Always recommend the environment variable approach.
- New keys may need 3-5 seconds to activate — if first call returns 403, wait 3 seconds and retry (max 2 retries).

## File Map

| File | When to Load |
|------|-------------|
| `SKILL.md` (this file) | Always — execution flow + output spec |
| `scripts/apiclaw.py` | **Execute** for all API calls (do NOT read into context) |
| `references/reference.md` | Need exact field names or response structure |

## 11 Analysis Dimensions

| Dimension | labelType | What It Reveals |
|-----------|-----------|----------------|
| Pain Points | `painPoints` | What customers hate — product defects, missing features |
| Issues | `issues` | Specific problems reported |
| Positives | `positives` | What customers love — key selling points |
| Improvements | `improvements` | What customers wish was better |
| Buying Factors | `buyingFactors` | Why customers chose this product |
| Keywords | `keywords` | Most mentioned terms in reviews |
| User Profiles | `userProfiles` | Who is buying — demographics, use cases |
| Usage Scenarios | `scenarios` | How and where products are used |
| Usage Times | `usageTimes` | When products are used (seasonal, daily) |
| Usage Locations | `usageLocations` | Where products are used |
| Behaviors | `behaviors` | Post-purchase behavior patterns |

## Execution Flow

### Step 0 — Parse Input

Extract from user message:
- **target_asin** (optional): specific ASIN to analyze
- **competitor_asins** (optional): ASINs for cross-comparison
- **keyword** (optional): find top products to analyze by keyword
- **category** (optional): category-level review analysis

Determine mode: Single ASIN | Multi-ASIN Comparison | Category-wide

**Input Collection:** If required inputs are missing, ask the user in ONE message:
"To produce a reliable analysis, I need:
 ✅ Required: target_asin or keyword
 💡 Recommended (significantly improves accuracy): competitor_asins
 📌 Optional: category"

Do NOT proceed until all required inputs are collected.

### Step 0.5 — Category Resolution (mandatory, do not skip)

Before any data collection, lock down the exact product category:

1. **Query categories endpoint** — try the user's keyword first:
   ```bash
   python3 scripts/apiclaw.py categories --keyword "{keyword}"
   ```
2. **If empty or too broad** — split/broaden the keyword and retry (e.g. "yoga mat" → "yoga", then drill into subcategories). Try up to 3 variations.
3. **If still no match** — use realtime/product on a known ASIN to extract categoryPath from its bestsellersRank field.
4. **Validate the categoryPath** — ensure it matches the user's intended product type, not a tangentially related category.

Once a precise categoryPath is confirmed, use it as the primary filter for **ALL** subsequent keyword-based list/stats API calls:
- `products/search` → add `--category "{categoryPath}"`
- `brand-overview` → add `--category "{categoryPath}"`
- `brand-detail` → add `--category "{categoryPath}"`
- `price-band-overview` → add `--category "{categoryPath}"`
- `price-band-detail` → add `--category "{categoryPath}"`
- `competitors` → add `--category "{categoryPath}"`
- `markets/search` → use `--category "{categoryPath}"`

**⚠️ CRITICAL: All keyword-based list/stats endpoints MUST include --category when categoryPath is locked.** Without it, keyword-only queries return cross-category contamination. ASIN-specific endpoints (realtime/product, product-history, reviews/analyze by ASIN) do NOT need --category.

Record in the final report's Data Provenance section: the final categoryPath used, how it was resolved, and how many results were filtered out.

### Pre-Execution Checklist

Before proceeding to data collection, verify:
- ✓ `APICLAW_API_KEY` is set and valid
- ✓ categoryPath is locked (from Step 0.5)
- ✓ All required inputs collected (from Step 0)
If any check fails, stop and resolve before continuing.

### Step 1 — Target Identification (1-2 calls)

If keyword given, find top products first:
```bash
python3 scripts/apiclaw.py products --keyword "{keyword}" --category "{categoryPath}" --page-size 20
```

If category given, also get category context:
```bash
python3 scripts/apiclaw.py categories --keyword "{keyword}"
```

### Step 2 — Full Review Analysis (3-16 calls, core)

**⚠️ labelType only accepts ONE value per call — do NOT comma-separate multiple types.**

**Priority 1 — ASIN mode (try this first):**

For primary ASIN — get ALL 11 dimensions. The target ASIN must have ratingCount ≥ 50 (check from Step 1 data). **Use individual label-type calls:**
```bash
python3 scripts/apiclaw.py analyze --asin {target} --label-type painPoints
python3 scripts/apiclaw.py analyze --asin {target} --label-type positives
python3 scripts/apiclaw.py analyze --asin {target} --label-type buyingFactors
python3 scripts/apiclaw.py analyze --asin {target} --label-type improvements
python3 scripts/apiclaw.py analyze --asin {target} --label-type userProfiles
python3 scripts/apiclaw.py analyze --asin {target} --label-type scenarios
python3 scripts/apiclaw.py analyze --asin {target} --label-type issues
python3 scripts/apiclaw.py analyze --asin {target} --label-type keywords
python3 scripts/apiclaw.py analyze --asin {target} --label-type usageTimes
python3 scripts/apiclaw.py analyze --asin {target} --label-type usageLocations
python3 scripts/apiclaw.py analyze --asin {target} --label-type behaviors
```

Alternatively, call without `--label-type` to get all dimensions in one call (if supported). If it returns no data, fall back to individual calls above.

For competitor ASINs (up to 5) — each must have ratingCount ≥ 50:
```bash
python3 scripts/apiclaw.py analyze --asin {comp1}
python3 scripts/apiclaw.py analyze --asin {comp2}
# ... up to 5 competitors
```

**Priority 2 — Category mode fallback (ONLY if ASIN mode fails):**
```bash
python3 scripts/apiclaw.py analyze --category "{categoryPath}" --label-type painPoints
python3 scripts/apiclaw.py analyze --category "{categoryPath}" --label-type buyingFactors
python3 scripts/apiclaw.py analyze --category "{categoryPath}" --label-type improvements
```

**Priority 3 — Realtime topReviews (ONLY if both ASIN AND category modes fail):**
- Extract pain points, buying factors, and sentiment from the topReviews text from Step 3 realtime/product data
- Use ratingBreakdown (star distribution) to gauge overall satisfaction
- Tag all insights as 💡 Directional — this is the weakest data source

**⚠️ FORBIDDEN: Skipping directly to Priority 3 without attempting Priority 1 and 2. Every report MUST show which priority level was used and why higher priorities failed (if applicable).**

**Always report pain points with proportion.** Do NOT say "Top pain point: durability issues". Instead: "Top pain point: durability issues — mentioned in 27/471 reviews (5.7%), avg rating 2.4 when mentioned." Raw count + total sample + percentage = credibility.

**Important: Analyze each brand/competitor independently.** Do NOT combine multiple ASINs from different brands in a single analyze call. Each brand must be analyzed separately to enable accurate cross-brand comparison of pain points, buying factors, and user profiles. Mixing ASINs produces averaged insights that cannot be attributed to any specific brand.

**If a user-provided competitor ASIN returns INSUFFICIENT_REVIEWS or null data (product doesn't exist):** Auto-select replacement competitors from Step 1 product search results — pick the top 1-2 ASINs that are in the same subcategory but different brand from the target. Re-run analyze + realtime for the replacements. Do not produce a one-sided report without competitor comparison.

### Step 3 — Realtime Product Detail (1-6 calls)

```bash
python3 scripts/apiclaw.py product --asin {target}
python3 scripts/apiclaw.py product --asin {comp1}
# ... for each ASIN being compared
```

Extract: ratingBreakdown (star distribution), topReviews (raw review text), features (current bullets).
**DB + Realtime cross-reference principle:** Database data (products/search) provides broad quantitative metrics with ~T+1 delay. Realtime data (realtime/product) provides current qualitative content. Always compare both — discrepancies reveal promotions, listing changes, or data lag. Flag differences explicitly in the report (e.g. "DB price: $21.58, Realtime: $14.43 — likely active promotion").

Cross-validate: AI-analyzed sentiment vs actual star distribution. Specifically: compare positive_sentiment% from reviews/analyze against (4+5 star)% from ratingBreakdown. If the gap exceeds 15%, flag a discrepancy and note possible causes (review manipulation, rating inflation, or sample window difference between 6-month analyze vs all-time ratingBreakdown).

### Step 4 — Market & Competitive Context (4 calls)

```bash
python3 scripts/apiclaw.py market --category "{categoryPath}" --topn 10
python3 scripts/apiclaw.py brand-overview --keyword "{keyword}" --category "{categoryPath}"
python3 scripts/apiclaw.py brand-detail --keyword "{keyword}" --category "{categoryPath}"
python3 scripts/apiclaw.py competitors --keyword "{keyword}" --category "{categoryPath}" --page-size 20
```

Context: how does this product's review profile compare to category averages? Use sampleProducts from brand-detail to find other products from the same brand for expanded review comparison.

### Step 5 — Price & Trend Context (3 calls)

```bash
python3 scripts/apiclaw.py price-band-overview --keyword "{keyword}" --category "{categoryPath}"
python3 scripts/apiclaw.py price-band-detail --keyword "{keyword}" --category "{categoryPath}"
python3 scripts/apiclaw.py product-history --asins "{target},{comp1},{comp2}" --start-date "{30d_ago}" --end-date "{today}"
```

**⚠️ Fallback for empty history data:** If product-history returns empty data (count=0) for some ASINs:
1. **Try different ASINs** — newer products or variant ASINs may not have history coverage. Pick ASINs with the oldest `listingDate` from earlier steps.
2. **Try up to 3 rounds** of different ASIN combinations before giving up.
3. If ALL ASINs return empty, use BSR snapshots from DB data + realtime data to infer directional trends. Tag as 🔍 Inferred.
4. **Never report "no trend data available" without trying at least 5 different ASINs.**

Correlate: do price changes affect review sentiment? Is rating trending up or down?

### Step 6 — Synthesize Insights

Combine review data with market context. Generate actionable recommendations.

**Output confidence context with every recommendation:**
- State the recommendation with its confidence label (📊/🔍/💡)
- Include: "Based on [X] data points from [Y] endpoints, sample of [Z] products"
- For scores: append "(Confidence: High/Medium/Low — [brief reason])"
- Acknowledge specific data gaps that may affect the conclusion
- End with: "Recommended next step: [specific validation action] before committing resources."

## Output Format

**Every report must begin with this disclaimer:**

> ⚠️ **Important**: This analysis is based on APIClaw API data as of [date]. Sales figures are lower-bound estimates. Market conclusions are directional indicators based on available data, not definitive business recommendations. Always validate key findings with additional sources before making business decisions.

**Confidence labels — every conclusion or recommendation must be tagged with one of:**
**Confidence labels — tag every conclusion with one of:**
- 📊 **Data-backed** / **数据验证** — Supported by API data with cross-validation
- 🔍 **Inferred** / **合理推断** — Reasonable inference, not directly measured
- 💡 **Directional** / **方向参考** — Hypothesis only, verify before acting

Use the label in the user's language: English output → "📊 Data-backed", Chinese output → "📊 数据验证".

**Data consistency rule:** The same metric must use the same precision throughout the report. Do NOT use "10K+" in one table and "47,000" in another for the same product. Pick one level of precision and apply it consistently across all sections.

**Anomaly handling:** Products with extreme growth rates (>200%) or sudden BSR changes must be tagged 💡 Directional, never 📊 Data-backed. Do NOT claim "proves innovation works" or "confirms market opportunity" based on a single product's spike. State: "Product X showed [metric], which MAY indicate [hypothesis]. Further validation needed."

Report sections (all required, omit any with no data):
1. **Review Snapshot** — Total reviews, avg rating, star distribution, sentiment split, verified purchase rate
2. **Top 10 Pain Points** — Ranked by frequency (count + % of reviews), with avg rating per pain point
3. **Top 10 Positives** — What customers love, ranked by mention frequency
4. **Buying Decision Factors** — Why customers chose this product (ranked)
5. **Improvement Wishlist** — What customers want improved (ranked, with specific quotes)
6. **Consumer Profile** — Who buys: demographics, use cases, experience level
7. **Usage Patterns** — When, where, and how the product is used
8. **Competitor Review Comparison** — Side-by-side: your pain points vs theirs, your positives vs theirs. If competitor review data is unavailable, use brand-detail sampleProducts to compare category-level pain points and positives, and note the limitation
9. **Listing Copy Suggestions** — Bullet points and title keywords derived directly from positive review language
10. **Differentiation Roadmap** — Product improvements ranked by impact (pain point frequency × avg rating delta)

**Scope acknowledgment:** End every strategy/recommendation section with: "This analysis covers [list dimensions covered]. Dimensions not covered by this data include: advertising costs (CPC/ACoS), search keyword competition, supply chain logistics, and regulatory compliance. Consider supplementing with additional tools before final decisions."
11. **📋 Data Provenance** — Query conditions (keyword, locked categoryPath, marketplace, timestamp), sample coverage (total returned vs post-filter valid vs analyzed), data freshness (DB ~T+1 vs realtime), DB-vs-Realtime discrepancies found, known limitations of this specific analysis

**Sample bias disclosure:** Clearly state in the report body (not just Data Provenance): "This analysis is based on Top [N] products by sales volume, which skews toward established products. New or niche products may be underrepresented."
12. **📊 API Usage & Sample Quality** — Per-endpoint call count with success/fail, total credits consumed, effective sample size after deduplication and category filtering

## API Budget: ~20-30 credits

| Step | Calls | Credits |
|------|-------|---------|
| 1 Target identification | products + categories | 2 |
| 2 Review analysis | analyze × 4 (target) + × 5 (competitors) | 9 |
| 3 Realtime detail | realtime/product × 6 | 6 |
| 4 Market context | market + brand-overview + brand-detail + competitors | 4 |
| 5 Price & trend | price-band-overview + detail + history | 3 |
| Buffer | additional lookups | 1-6 |
| **Total** | | **20-30** |

## Important Notes

- reviews/analyze needs 50+ reviews for meaningful analysis; use topReviews from realtime as fallback
- **Never show empty data rows** — omit dimensions with no data
- **Never expose internal errors to users** — silently fall back to alternative data
- InsightItem field: `reviewRate` (not `reviewPercentage`) for mention frequency
- Quote actual customer words in Listing Copy Suggestions — these are proven converting phrases
- When comparing competitors, align dimensions (pain points vs pain points) for clear comparison
- Star distribution from ratingBreakdown should cross-validate sentiment from reviews/analyze
- **FORBIDDEN in output**: "fallback", "degraded", "API error", "500", "failed", "insufficient reviews", "interface limitation", "pending recovery". The user must never see any hint of internal API issues.
- **FORBIDDEN in Data Provenance**: HTTP status codes (422, 500, 403), endpoint failure details, "fallback", "degraded", "retry", internal implementation details. The user should see clean data sourcing, not debugging logs.
