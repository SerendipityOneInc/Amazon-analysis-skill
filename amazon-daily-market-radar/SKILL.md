# APIClaw — Amazon Daily Market Radar

> Set it. Forget it. Get alerted when it matters.
>
> **Language rule**: Always respond in the user's language. Chinese input → Chinese output.
> All API calls go through `scripts/apiclaw.py`.

## Credentials

- Required: `APICLAW_API_KEY`
- Scope: used only for `https://api.apiclaw.io`
- Setup: Guide user to set the environment variable:
  ```bash
  export APICLAW_API_KEY='hms_live_xxxxxx'
  ```
- Get a free key at [apiclaw.io/api-keys](https://apiclaw.io/en/api-keys) (1,000 free credits on signup, no credit card required)
- Fallback: The script also checks `config.json` in the skill root directory if the env var is not set.
- **Do NOT write keys to disk files.** Always recommend the environment variable approach.
- New keys may need 3-5 seconds to activate — if first call returns 403, wait 3 seconds and retry (max 2 retries).

## File Map

| File | When to Load |
|------|-------------|
| `SKILL.md` (this file) | Always — execution flow + alert rules |
| `scripts/apiclaw.py` | **Execute** for all API calls (do NOT read into context) |
| `references/reference.md` | Need exact field names or response structure |

## Setup — First Run

On first use, collect the user's watchlist:
- **my_asins**: user's own product ASINs (1-10)
- **competitor_asins**: key competitors to track (up to 20)
- **keywords**: category keywords for market-level monitoring (1-5)
- **alert_preferences**: which alerts matter most (price/BSR/reviews/competitors)

**Input Collection:** If required inputs are missing, ask the user in ONE message:
"To produce a reliable analysis, I need:
 ✅ Required: my_asins + keyword
 💡 Recommended (significantly improves accuracy): competitor_asins
 📌 Optional: alert_preferences"

Do NOT proceed until all required inputs are collected.

Store the watchlist and each run's snapshot data in a `data/` directory (e.g. `data/watchlist.json`, `data/last-run.json`). On repeat runs, load the previous snapshot for change detection. Without a previous run, first run establishes the baseline — no "new competitor" alerts will fire.

## Execution Flow

### Step 0.5 — Category Resolution (mandatory, do not skip)

Before any data collection, lock down the exact product category:

1. **Query categories endpoint** — try the user's keyword first:
   ```bash
   python3 scripts/apiclaw.py categories --keyword "{keyword}"
   ```
2. **If empty or too broad** — split/broaden the keyword and retry (e.g. "yoga mat" → "yoga", then drill into subcategories). Try up to 3 variations.
3. **If still no match** — use realtime/product on a known ASIN to extract categoryPath from its bestsellersRank field.
4. **Validate the categoryPath** — ensure it matches the user's intended product type, not a tangentially related category.

Once a precise categoryPath is confirmed, use it as the primary filter for **ALL** subsequent keyword-based list/stats API calls:
- `products/search` → add `--category "{categoryPath}"`
- `brand-overview` → add `--category "{categoryPath}"`
- `brand-detail` → add `--category "{categoryPath}"`
- `price-band-overview` → add `--category "{categoryPath}"`
- `price-band-detail` → add `--category "{categoryPath}"`
- `competitors` → add `--category "{categoryPath}"`
- `markets/search` → use `--category "{categoryPath}"`

**⚠️ CRITICAL: All keyword-based list/stats endpoints MUST include --category when categoryPath is locked.** Without it, keyword-only queries return cross-category contamination. ASIN-specific endpoints (realtime/product, product-history, reviews/analyze by ASIN) do NOT need --category.

Record in the final report's Data Provenance section: the final categoryPath used, how it was resolved, and how many results were filtered out.

### Pre-Execution Checklist

Before proceeding to data collection, verify:
- ✓ `APICLAW_API_KEY` is set and valid
- ✓ categoryPath is locked (from Step 0.5)
- ✓ All required inputs collected (from Step 0)
If any check fails, stop and resolve before continuing.

### Step 1 — Realtime Snapshot for All Tracked ASINs (5-15 calls)

```bash
python3 scripts/apiclaw.py product --asin {my_asin_1}
python3 scripts/apiclaw.py product --asin {my_asin_2}
python3 scripts/apiclaw.py product --asin {comp_1}
python3 scripts/apiclaw.py product --asin {comp_2}
# ... all tracked ASINs
```

For each: current price, rating, ratingCount, BSR, BuyBox winner, availability.

**DB + Realtime cross-reference principle:** Database data (products/search) provides broad quantitative metrics with ~T+1 delay. Realtime data (realtime/product) provides current qualitative content. Always compare both — discrepancies reveal promotions, listing changes, or data lag. Flag differences explicitly in the report (e.g. "DB price: $21.58, Realtime: $14.43 — likely active promotion").

### Step 2 — Historical Comparison (1-2 calls)

```bash
python3 scripts/apiclaw.py product-history --asins "{all_tracked}" --start-date "{7d_ago}" --end-date "{today}"
```

**⚠️ Fallback for empty history data:** If product-history returns empty data (count=0) for some ASINs:
1. **Try different ASINs** — newer products or variant ASINs may not have history coverage. Pick ASINs with the oldest `listingDate` from earlier steps.
2. **Try up to 3 rounds** of different ASIN combinations before giving up.
3. If ALL ASINs return empty, use BSR snapshots from DB data + realtime data to infer directional trends. Tag as 🔍 Inferred.
4. **Never report "no trend data available" without trying at least 5 different ASINs.**

Compare today's snapshot vs 7-day history. Detect: price changes >5%, BSR moves >20%, sales spikes/drops.

**Quantify trends, don't just label them.** Instead of "price stable" or "BSR rising", calculate and report:
- Price change rate: (latest - earliest) / earliest × 100%
- BSR volatility: (max - min) / average × 100%
- Sales trend direction: regression slope over the period
Use these numbers to support trend labels.

**Growth signal validation:** When flagging BSR improvements or sales spikes, distinguish between:
- 📊 **Sustained trend** — multiple data points over 7+ days showing consistent direction
- 🔍 **Possible signal** — 2-3 days of change, needs more observation
- 💡 **Single-day spike** — could be promotion, restock, or data lag; do not alert as RED/YELLOW without confirmation

**Note:** The most recent day's history data often has `bsrRank: null, recentSales: null` (scrape not yet completed). Use the most recent non-null entry as the historical baseline. Step 1 realtime data serves as the authoritative current snapshot.

### Step 3 — Market Pulse (3 calls per keyword)

```bash
python3 scripts/apiclaw.py market --category "{categoryPath}" --topn 10
python3 scripts/apiclaw.py brand-overview --keyword "{keyword}" --category "{categoryPath}"
python3 scripts/apiclaw.py brand-detail --keyword "{keyword}" --category "{categoryPath}"
```

**Category validation:** Cross-check sampleProducts from brand-detail against the target product's categoryPath. Exclude brands whose products are primarily in unrelated categories (e.g. flip-flop brand appearing for "yoga mat" keyword due to title stuffing). This is critical for automated runs — off-topic brands would poison the daily briefing.

Check: market size changes, new brands entering, brand share shifts. Use sampleProducts from brand-detail to detect new product launches from tracked brands.

### Step 4 — New Competitor Detection (1 call per keyword)

```bash
python3 scripts/apiclaw.py products --keyword "{keyword}" --category "{categoryPath}" --page-size 20
```

Compare today's top 20 against previous run. Flag any new ASINs not seen before.

### Step 5 — Price Landscape Check (2 calls per keyword)

```bash
python3 scripts/apiclaw.py price-band-overview --keyword "{keyword}" --category "{categoryPath}"
python3 scripts/apiclaw.py price-band-detail --keyword "{keyword}" --category "{categoryPath}"
```

Detect: shifts in price band distribution, opportunity index changes.

### Step 6 — Category Context (1 call, optional)

```bash
python3 scripts/apiclaw.py categories --keyword "{keyword}"
```

If categories returns empty (common for multi-word keywords like "yoga mat"), skip this step — category path is already available from Step 1 realtime product data (`bestsellersRank` field).

### Step 7 — Review Pulse (1-3 calls)

**⚠️ labelType only accepts ONE value per call — do NOT comma-separate multiple types.**

**Priority 1 — ASIN mode (try this first):**
```bash
# my_asin must have ratingCount ≥ 50
python3 scripts/apiclaw.py analyze --asin {my_asin}
```
⚠️ The ASIN must have ratingCount ≥ 50. If <50 reviews, pick a different tracked ASIN with more reviews.

**Priority 2 — Realtime topReviews (ONLY if ASIN mode fails):**
- Extract sentiment shifts and new pain points from the topReviews text from Step 1 realtime/product data
- Use ratingBreakdown (star distribution) to gauge satisfaction trends
- Tag all insights as 💡 Directional — this is the weakest data source

**⚠️ FORBIDDEN: Skipping directly to topReviews without attempting ASIN mode first.**

Track: review count velocity, sentiment shifts, new pain points emerging.

### Step 8 — Generate Daily Briefing

**First-run detection:** If `data/last-run.json` does not exist, this is the first run. Output a "Baseline Established" template instead of a change-detection briefing:
- State clearly: "This is the first run — baseline data has been captured. Change detection and alerts will be available starting from the next run."
- Still output the KPI Dashboard (current snapshot) and Market Shifts (current state) sections
- Save current data to `data/last-run.json` for future comparison
- Do NOT generate RED/YELLOW/GREEN alerts (no baseline to compare against)

**Subsequent runs:** Compile all changes into alert-prioritized briefing.

## Alert Rules

| Alert Level | Trigger | Example |
|------------|---------|---------|
| RED | Price drop >10% by competitor | Comp X dropped from $19.99 to $14.99 |
| RED | BSR crash >50% (your product) | Your BSR went from #23 to #60 |
| RED | 1-star review spike (3+ in 24h) | 4 new 1-star reviews detected |
| YELLOW | New competitor in Top 20 | New ASIN B0XXX entered Top 20 |
| YELLOW | Competitor price change 5-10% | Comp Y raised price by 8% |
| YELLOW | BSR change 20-50% | Your BSR moved from #23 to #35 |
| YELLOW | Brand share shift >2% | Brand Z gained 3% market share |
| GREEN | Competitor stock-out detected | Comp W BuyBox shows "Currently unavailable" |
| GREEN | Your review velocity up | 15% more reviews this week vs last |
| GREEN | Price band opportunity shift | New opportunity in $15-$20 band (opp 1.3→1.5) |

**Output confidence context with every recommendation:**
- State the recommendation with its confidence label (📊/🔍/💡)
- Include: "Based on [X] data points from [Y] endpoints, sample of [Z] products"
- For scores: append "(Confidence: High/Medium/Low — [brief reason])"
- Acknowledge specific data gaps that may affect the conclusion
- End with: "Recommended next step: [specific validation action] before committing resources."

## Output Format

**Every report must begin with this disclaimer:**

> ⚠️ **Important**: This analysis is based on APIClaw API data as of [date]. Sales figures are lower-bound estimates. Market conclusions are directional indicators based on available data, not definitive business recommendations. Always validate key findings with additional sources before making business decisions.

**Confidence labels — every conclusion or recommendation must be tagged with one of:**
**Confidence labels — tag every conclusion with one of:**
- 📊 **Data-backed** / **数据验证** — Supported by API data with cross-validation
- 🔍 **Inferred** / **合理推断** — Reasonable inference, not directly measured
- 💡 **Directional** / **方向参考** — Hypothesis only, verify before acting

Use the label in the user's language: English output → "📊 Data-backed", Chinese output → "📊 数据验证".

**Data consistency rule:** The same metric must use the same precision throughout the report. Do NOT use "10K+" in one table and "47,000" in another for the same product. Pick one level of precision and apply it consistently across all sections.

**Anomaly handling:** Products with extreme growth rates (>200%) or sudden BSR changes must be tagged 💡 Directional, never 📊 Data-backed. Do NOT claim "proves innovation works" or "confirms market opportunity" based on a single product's spike. State: "Product X showed [metric], which MAY indicate [hypothesis]. Further validation needed."

Daily briefing (all sections, omit any with no alerts):
1. **Alert Summary** — Count of RED/YELLOW/GREEN alerts
2. **RED Alerts** — Immediate action required, with specific recommendations
3. **YELLOW Alerts** — Monitor closely, suggested response if trend continues
4. **GREEN Opportunities** — Positive changes to capitalize on
5. **KPI Dashboard** — Your ASINs: price, BSR, rating, reviews (today vs yesterday)
6. **Competitor Movement** — Price/BSR/review changes for tracked competitors
7. **Market Shifts** — Category-level changes (size, concentration, new entrants)
8. **Action Items** — Prioritized to-do list based on alerts

**Scope acknowledgment:** End every strategy/recommendation section with: "This analysis covers [list dimensions covered]. Dimensions not covered by this data include: advertising costs (CPC/ACoS), search keyword competition, supply chain logistics, and regulatory compliance. Consider supplementing with additional tools before final decisions."
9. **📋 Data Provenance** — Query conditions (keyword, locked categoryPath, marketplace, timestamp), sample coverage (total returned vs post-filter valid vs analyzed), data freshness (DB ~T+1 vs realtime), DB-vs-Realtime discrepancies found, known limitations of this specific analysis

**Sample bias disclosure:** Clearly state in the report body (not just Data Provenance): "This analysis is based on Top [N] products by sales volume, which skews toward established products. New or niche products may be underrepresented."
10. **📊 API Usage & Sample Quality** — Per-endpoint call count with success/fail, total credits consumed, effective sample size after deduplication and category filtering

## API Budget: ~15-30 credits (depends on watchlist size)

| Step | Calls | Credits |
|------|-------|---------|
| 1 Realtime snapshot | realtime/product × (my + comp ASINs) | 5-15 |
| 2 Historical comparison | product-history × 1-2 | 1-2 |
| 3 Market pulse | market + brand-overview + brand-detail | 3 |
| 4 New competitor detection | products/search | 1 |
| 5 Price landscape | price-band-overview + detail | 2 |
| 6 Category context | categories | 1 |
| 7 Review pulse | reviews/analyze × 1-3 | 1-3 |
| **Total** | | **15-30** |

## Important Notes

- Designed for daily automated runs — no user interaction needed after initial setup
- **Never show empty data rows** — omit alerts with no changes
- **Never expose internal errors** — silently fall back to alternative data
- **FORBIDDEN in output**: "fallback", "degraded", "API error", "500", "failed", "insufficient reviews"
- **FORBIDDEN in Data Provenance**: HTTP status codes (422, 500, 403), endpoint failure details, "fallback", "degraded", "retry", internal implementation details. The user should see clean data sourcing, not debugging logs.
- Compare against previous run data when available; first run has no comparison baseline
- Highest retention skill — users come back daily. Keep output concise and actionable
- For agent automation: can be triggered by cron/scheduler with saved watchlist
